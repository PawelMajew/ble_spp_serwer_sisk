## Project Description
The project focuses on implementing a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server with Serial Port Profile (SPP) support. The main goal is to create a system that enables wireless communication between a central device and a peripheral device using the BLE SPP standard.

## Project Structure

### 1. `ble_spp_server`
This files serves as the core of the project where server configuration and startup take place.

### 2. `gap`
The `gap` file contains code responsible for handling the Generic Access Profile (GAP). This module deals with general aspects of BLE communication, such as device initialization, connection management, and overall event handling.

### 3. `gatt`
The `gatt` file contains code related to handling the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) and Serial Port Profile (SPP). GATT defines the structure and data exchange between the central and peripheral devices, while SPP allows for emulating a serial port over BLE.

## Running the Project
